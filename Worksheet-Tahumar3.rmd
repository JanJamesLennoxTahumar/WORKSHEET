#Worksheet 3A
Using Vectors

1. There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet and letters which
contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
```{}
LETTERS ## [1] “A” “B” “C” “D” “E” “F” “G” “H” “I” “J”
“K” “L” “M” “N” “O” “P” “Q” “R” “S” ## [20] “T” “U” “V” “W” “X” “Y” “Z” letters ## [1] “a” “b” “c”
“d” “e” “f” “g” “h” “i” “j” “k” “l” “m” “n” “o” “p” “q” “r” “s” ## [20] “t” “u” “v” “w” “x” “y” “z” 
```
Based on
the above vector LETTERS: 
  
a. You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.

```{}
FIRST_LETTERS <- LETTERS[1:11]
FIRST_LETTERS
```

## [1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I" "J" "K"


b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.

```{}
ODD <- LETTERS [1:26 %% 2 == 1]
ODD
```


## [1] "A" "C" "E" "G" "I" "K" "M" "O" "Q" "S" "U" "W" "Y"


c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels.

```{}
VOWEL_LETTERS <- LETTERS [c(1,5,9,15,21)]
VOWEL_LETTERS
```

## [1] "A" "E" "I" "O" "U"


Based on the above vector letters:
  
d. Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.

```{}
FIVE_LETTERS <- LETTERS[22:26]
FIVE_LETTERS
```

## [1] "u" "v" "w" "x" "y"

## [5] "Samal Island" "Davao City"


b. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees. Name the object as temp.
Write the R code and its output. Numbers should also follow what is in the instruction.

TEMP <-c(42, 39, 34, 34, 30, 27)
TEMP
```

## [1] 42 39 34 34 30 27
